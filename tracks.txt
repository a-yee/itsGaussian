Implementation Notes:
1. created fb_uniFreq.csv and uni_emails.mat from count_unique.m function (cite
        online source)

2. row index extraction (single string) from {http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29932085/find-the-index-of-the-row-in-data-frame-that-contain-one-element-in-a-string-vec}

3. cbind.fill function from {http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7962267/cbind-a-df-with-an-empty-df-cbind-fill/7962286#7962286}
